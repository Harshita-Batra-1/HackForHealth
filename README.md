Tagline - SHE Built, SHE Wins!

Problem Statement:
Menstrual hygiene is a pervasive issue affecting girls in South Asia, with over a third of them missing school during their periods due to inadequate access to toilets and pads, coupled with a lack of proper education about menstruation. Globally, 1.2 billion women face challenges related to basic sanitation and hygiene, contributing to period poverty and perpetuating societal stigma. The existing healthcare system does not effectively address the physical and psychological needs of women during their menstrual cycles, further exacerbating the problem.

Solution:
Comprehensive Menstrual Education Programs: Implement educational initiatives to raise awareness about menstruation, hygiene practices, and debunk myths. Collaborate with schools, community centers, and local authorities to integrate comprehensive menstrual education into curricula.

Infrastructure Improvement: Work towards providing better sanitation facilities in schools, including the availability of toilets and sanitary pads. Advocate for policies that address menstrual hygiene in educational institutions.

Technology-Driven Healthcare Platform: Develop a user-friendly platform offering personalized feedback, period cycle tracking, and mood analysis. This platform should facilitate easy access to healthcare information, enabling women to make informed decisions about their well-being.

Telemedicine Services: Integrate telemedicine services into the platform, allowing women to schedule appointments with gynecologists and receive consultations from the comfort of their homes. This ensures privacy and convenience.

Community Engagement through Blogging: Establish a blogging platform for women (Shewinners) to share experiences, knowledge, and insights on menstruation, breaking stereotypes. Encourage open discussions to foster a supportive community that contributes positively to societal change.

Collaboration with Healthcare Providers: Partner with hospitals and healthcare professionals to ensure that women have access to quality healthcare services. Facilitate workshops and awareness programs conducted by healthcare providers to empower women with accurate information.

By addressing these aspects comprehensively, the proposed solution aims to tackle menstrual hygiene issues, break societal taboos, and empower women to take charge of their health and education.

FUTURE SCOPE:

Challenges:
Limited Access to Toilets and Pads: Many girls lack access to essential sanitary facilities and products in schools, hindering their education during menstruation.

Insufficient Menstrual Education: Inadequate information and education about menstruation contribute to the perpetuation of myths, taboos, and stigma surrounding periods.

Lack of Personalized Healthcare: Women often face challenges in seeking personalized healthcare, including period tracking, mood analysis, and access to healthcare professionals.

Social Stigma: Long-standing social stigma surrounding menstruation hinders open discussions and contributes to the reluctance of women in seeking proper healthcare and education.
